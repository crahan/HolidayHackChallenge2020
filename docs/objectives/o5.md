## Being Santa Claus
Walk to the end of the dark hallway and through the glowing lights to enter Santa's body. This is a direct reference to the movie Being John Malkovich and is explained in more detail in the [Easter Egg](../easter_eggs.md#being-john-malkovich) section. It's also where the idea for [this image](../img/misc/being_santa_clause.png) came from. :smile:

    what the hell is this

    I hear another Santa in my head

You can now roam around as Santa and use the elevator to get to Santa's Office. This also unlocks a whole new set of narratives between Santa and the other NPCs, like the [conference booths](../easter_eggs.md#santa-discounts). Things are starting to make a little more sense now. It appears that Jack Frost has been impersonating Santa and causing all kinds of trouble! :open_mouth:
