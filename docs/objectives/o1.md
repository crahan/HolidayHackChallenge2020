    It can be hard when things are twirly. There are tools that can help!
    
    It also helps to select the correct twirly area.

## Hints

    There are [tools](https://www.photopea.com/) out there that could help Filter the Distortion that is this Twirl.

## Solution

![Untwirl](../img/objectives/o1/untwirl.png)

Depending on the image edit, some manipulations are reversible. Download and open the [billboard image](../artifacts/objectives/o1/billboard.png) image in the online [image editing tool](https://www.photopea.com/) Jingle Ringford recommends. Select the area around the scrambled letter and apply a *Twirl* filter with a positive angle value using `Filter` > `Distort` > `Twirl` to unscramble the selected image area.
