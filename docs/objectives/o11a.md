## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Even though the chunk of the blockchain that you have ends with block 129996, can you predict the nonce for block 130000? Talk to Tangle Coalbox in the Speaker UNpreparedness Room for tips on prediction and Tinsel Upatree for more tips and [tools](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/OfficialNaughtyNiceBlockchainEducationPack.zip). (Enter just the 16-character hex value of the nonce)

    Howdy Santa! Just guarding the Naughty/Nice list on your desk.
    
    Santa, I don't know if you've heard, but something is very, very wrong...
    
    We tabulated the latest score of the Naughty/Nice Blockchain.
    
    Jack Frost is the nicest being in the world! Jack Frost!?!
    
    As you know, we only really start checking the Naughty/Nice totals as we get closer to the holidays.
    
    Out of nowhere, Jack Frost has this crazy score... positive 4,294,935,958 nice points!
    
    No one has EVER gotten a score that high! No one knows how it happened.
    
    Most of us recall Jack having a NEGATIVE score only a few days ago...
    
    Worse still, his huge positive score seems to have happened way back in March.
    
    Our first thought was that he somehow changed the blockchain - but, as you know, that isn't possible.
    
    We ran a validation of the blockchain and it all checks out.
    
    Even the smallest change to any block should make it invalid.
    
    Blockchains are huge, so we cut a one minute chunk from when Jack's big score registered back in March.
    
    You can get a slice of the Naughty/Nice blockchain on your desk.
    
    You can get some [tools to help you here](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/OfficialNaughtyNiceBlockchainEducationPack.zip).
    
    Tangle Coalbox, in the Speaker UNPreparedness room. has been talking with attendees about the issue.


## Hints

??? hint "Tangle Coalbox"
    If you have control over to bytes in a file, it's easy to create MD5 [hash collisions](https://github.com/corkami/collisions). Problem is: there's that nonce that he would have to know ahead of time.
## Solution

To solve this we need a few components. As Santa, grab the [`blockchain.dat`](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/blockchain.dat) file from the desk in your office. We'll also need the `naughty_nice.py` script from the [official Naughty/Nice Blockchain education pack](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/OfficialNaughtyNiceBlockchainEducationPack.zip) so we can load the `blockchain.dat` file and extract the nonces. Finally, grab a copy of the `mt19937.py` script from Tom Liston's [mt19937](https://github.com/tliston/mt19937) GitHub repository that will allow us to clone a Mersenne Twister pseudo random number generator (PRNG).

!!! note "Two libraries, same outcome"
    Solving this challenge using Tom Liston's [`mt19937.py`](https://github.com/tliston/mt19937) script requires some additional modifications as the script is built around 32-bit values while the nonces in the `blockchain.dat` file are 64-bit. An alternative is to use the [mersenne-twister-predictor](https://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor) Python libary by Kimiyuki Onaka which supports different bit lengths out of the box. The final [`generate_nonce.py`](../tools/objectives/o11a/generate_nonce.py) script uses both libraries to ultimately predict the same values.

Open the `blockchain.dat` file (line 2) and read all the [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) values into a list (lines 11-12).

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 11-12"
if __name__ == '__main__':
    c2 = Chain(load=True, filename='blockchain.dat')

    # print some blockchain stats
    print(f'The chain contains {len(c2.blocks)} blocks')
    print(f'First block has index {c2.blocks[0].index}')
    print(f'Last block has index {c2.blocks[-1].index}')
    
    # dump all the nonces from the blockchain
    nonce_list = []
    for block in c2.blocks:
        nonce_list.append(block.nonce)
```

Create two MT19937 PRNGs. One using [Kimiyuki Onaka's library](ttps://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor) (`kmyk`) and one based on [Tom's sample code](https://github.com/tliston/mt19937) (`tliston`).

```python linenums="1"
    # create a kmyk MT19937 PRNG predictor 
    # https://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor
    kmyk = MT19937Predictor()

    # create a Tom Liston MT19937 PRNG predictor 
    # https://github.com/tliston/mt19937
    tliston = mt19937(0)
```

To recreate the state of the PRNG that was used to generate the nonce values, we take the nonces from the `blockchain.dat` file and feed them into each of the PRNG objects. For a 32-bit Mersenne Twister at least 624 values are required. Mersenne Twister implementations based on [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Algorithmic_detail) sizes require only half as many.

For `kmyk` we can use all available 64-bit nonces as-is (line 3). For the `tliston` implementation which is built around 32-bit sizes we first need to convert the 64-bit values. Take 312 of the 64-bit nonce values, split each of them into two 32-bit sized parts, and feed each 32-bit value through the PRNG's `untemper()` function (lines 9 and 11).

!!! note "Generating 64-bit random numbers"
    A quick way to generate a 64-bit random number is by generating two 32-bit values, left-shifting one of the parts by 32 bits and adding both together. Tom hints at this in his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo5Nlbqd-Vg) stating that *most programming languages are very concerned with speed*. We leverage this conversion method to use Tom Liston's Mersenne Twister implementation (which is built around 32-bit sizes) with 64-bit input values.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3 9 11"
    # use all but the final 5 nonces for kmyk
    for nonce in nonce_list[:-5]:
        kmyk.setrandbits(nonce, 64)

    # use 312 64-bit nonces, excluding the final 5, for tliston
    idx = 0
    for nonce in nonce_list[-317:-5]:
        # least significant 32-bit
        tliston.MT[idx] = untemper(nonce & 0xFFFFFFFF)
        # most significant 32-bit
        tliston.MT[idx+1] = untemper((nonce >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF)
        idx += 2
```

The reason we did not use the final 5 nonce values to clone the PRNG is so we'd have something to compare our predicted values against. Generating the next 5 random numbers using the `kmyk` (line 8) and `tliston` (line 10) PRNGs should match the last 5 nonces from the blockchain.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="8 10"
    # generate the next 5 values and compare them to the final 5 in the blockchain
    print('\nVerifying correctness using the last 5 blockchain nonces:')
    print('\nIndex   kmyk              tliston           Blockchain        Check')
    for i in range(5):
        # blockchain verification value
        nonce_next = nonce_list[-5+i]
        # next kmyk value
        kmyk_next = kmyk.getrandbits(64)
        # next tliston value
        tliston_next = extract_number_64(tliston)
        # comparison table
        print('%i  %16.16x  %16.16x  %16.16x  %r' % (
            c2.blocks[-5+i].index,
            kmyk_next,
            tliston_next,
            nonce_next,
            (kmyk_next == tliston_next == nonce_next)
        ))
        assert(kmyk_next == tliston_next == nonce_next)
```

Run the script to verify that everything is working as intended.

The 5 generated values from both cloned PRNGs match up with the 5 final nonce values from the `blockchain.dat` file. The final part of the script uses the `kmyk` (line 6) and `tliston` (line 8) PRNGs to predict the next 4 nonces up to block 130000.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="6 8"
    # predict the next 4 random values
    print('\nGenerating the next values:')
    print('\nIndex   kmyk              tliston')
    for i in range(4):
        # kmyk answer
        kmyk_next = kmyk.getrandbits(64)
        # tliston answer
        tliston_next = extract_number_64(tliston)
        # prediction table
        print('%i  %16.16x  %16.16x' % (
            c2.blocks[-1].index + i + 1,
            kmyk_next,
            tliston_next,
        ))
```
