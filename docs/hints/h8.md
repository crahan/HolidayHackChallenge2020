## Request

    Hi, so glad to see you! I'm Holly Evergreen.<br/>
    I've been working with this Redis-based terminal here.<br/>
    We're quite sure there's a bug in it, but we haven't caught it yet.<br/>
    The maintenance port is available for curling, if you'd like to investigate.<br/>
    Can you check the source of the `index.php` page and look for the bug?<br/>
    I read something online recently about remote code execution on Redis. That might help!<br/>
    I think I got close to RCE, but I get mixed up between commas and plusses.<br/>
    You'll figure it out, I'm sure!


## Hints

??? hint "Redis RCE"
    [This](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis) is kind of what we're trying to do...


## Solution

??? abstract "Welcome message"
    ```text
    We need your help!!

    The server stopped working, all that's left is the maintenance port.

    To access it, run:

    curl http://localhost/maintenance.php

    We're pretty sure the bug is in the index page. Can you somehow use the
    maintenance page to view the source code for the index page?
    ```

Solution here...

    See? I knew you could to it!<br/>
    I wonder, could we figure out the problem with the Tag Generator if we can get the source code?<br/>
    Can you figure out the path to the script?<br/>
    I've discovered that enumerating all endpoints is a really good idea to understand an application's functionality.<br/>
    Sometimes I find the Content-Type header hinders the browser more than it helps.<br/>
    If you find a way to execute code blindly, maybe you can redirect to a file then download that file?
