## Request

!!! quote "Minty Candycane"
    Hey there, KringleCon attendee! I'm Minty Candycane!<br/>
    I'm working on fixing the Present Sort-O-Matic.<br/>
    The Sort-O-Matic uses JavaScript regular expressions to sort presents apart from misfit toys, but it's not working right.<br/>
    With some tools, regexes need / at the beginning and the ends, but they aren't used here.<br/>
    You can find a regular expression cheat sheet [here](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript) if you need it.<br/>
    You can use [this](https://regex101.com/) regex interpreter to test your regex against the required Sort-O-Matic patterns.<br/>
    Do you think you can help me fix it?


## Hints

??? hint "JavaScript Regex Cheat Sheet"
    Handy quick reference for JS regular expression construction: [https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript)

    Here's a place to try out your JS Regex expressions: [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/)


## Solution

The [cheatsheet](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript) provides really all that's required to complete this challenge. Each question has a popup with examples of what should and should not be matched. Copy each example into [regex101](https://regex101.com/) to verify that the regex pattern works as expected.

    Great job! You make this look easy!<br/>
    Hey, have you tried the Splunk challenge?<br/>
    Are you newer to SOC operations? Maybe check out his [intro talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIhHhRKQCw) from last year.<br/>
    Dave Herrald is doing a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVgEFt08kU) on tracking adversary emulation through Splunk!<br/>
    Don't forget about useful tools including Cyber Chef for decoding and decrypting data!<br/>
    It's down in the Great Room, but oh, they probably won't let an attendee operate it.
