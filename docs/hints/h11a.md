## Request

    Howdy gumshoe. I'm Tangle Coalbox, resident sleuth in the North Pole.<br/>
    If you're up for a challenge, I'd ask you to look at this here Snowball Game.<br/>
    We tested an earlier version this summer, but that one had web socket vulnerabilities.<br/>
    This version seems simple enough on the Easy level, but the Impossible level is, well...<br/>
    I'd call it impossible, but I just saw someone beat it! I'm sure something's off here.<br/>
    Could it be that the name a player provides has some connection to how the forts are laid out?<br/>
    Knowing that, I can see how an elf might feed their Hard name into an Easy game to cheat a bit.<br/>
    But on Impossible, the best you get are rejected player names in the page comments. Can you use those somehow?<br/>
    Check out Tom Liston's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo5Nlbqd-Vg) for more info, if you need it.


## Hints

??? hint "Mersenne Twister"
    Python uses the venerable Mersenne Twister algorithm to generate PRNG values after seed. Given enough data, an attacker might [predict](https://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor/blob/master/readme.md) upcoming values.

??? hint "PRNG Seeding"
    While system time is probably most common, developers have the option to [seed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) pseudo-random number generators with other values.

??? hint "Extra Instances"
    Need extra Snowball Game instances? Pop them up in a new tab from [https://snowball2.kringlecastle.com](https://snowball2.kringlecastle.com).

??? hint "Twisted Talk"
    Tom Liston is giving two talks at once - amazing! One is about the [Mersenne Twister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo5Nlbqd-Vg).

    Crikey - that's it! You've done the Impossible! You've impressed this old elf today.<br/>
    Great work identifying and abusing the pseudo-random sequence.<br/>
    Now, the REAL question is, how else can this be abused? Do you think someone could try and cheat the Naughty/Nice Blockchain with this?<br/>
    If you have control over to bytes in a file, it's easy to create MD5 [hash collisions](https://github.com/corkami/collisions).<br/>
    Problem is: there's that nonce that he would have to know ahead of time.<br/>
    A blockchain works by "chaining" blocks together - so there's no way that Jack could change it without it messing up the chain...<br/>
    Maybe if you look at the block that seems like it got changed, it might help.<br/>
    If Jack was able to change the block AND the document without changing the hash... that would require a very [UNIque hash COLLision](https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/hashclash).<br/>
    Apparently Jack was able to change just 4 bytes in the block to completely change everything about it. It's like some sort of [evil game](https://speakerdeck.com/ange/colltris) to him.
