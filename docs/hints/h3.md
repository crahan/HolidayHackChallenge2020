    You did it - great! Maybe you can help me configure my postfix mail server on Gentoo!<br/>
    Just kidding!<br/>
    Hey, wouldja' mind helping me get into my point-of-sale terminal?<br/>
    It's down, and we kinda' need it running.<br/>
    Problem is: it is asking for a password. I never set one!<br/>
    Can you help me figure out what it is so I can get set up?<br/>
    Shinny says this might be an Electron application.<br/>
    I hear there's a way to extract an ASAR file from the binary, but I haven't looked into it yet.<br/>
