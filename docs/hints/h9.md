    Great job! Thanks!<br/>
    Those skills might be useful to you later on!<br/>
    I've been trying those skills out myself on this other terminal.<br/>
    I'm pretty sure I can use tcpdump to sniff some packets.<br/>
    Then I'm going to try a machine-in-the-middle attack.<br/>
    Next, I'll spoof a DNS response to point the host to my terminal.<br/>
    Then I want to respond to its HTTP request with something I'll cook up.<br/>
    I'm almost there, but I can't quite get it. I could use some help!<br/>
    For privacy reasons though, I can't let you access this other terminal.<br/>
    I do plan to ask Santa for a hand with it next time he's nearby, though.
